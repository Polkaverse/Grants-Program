## Project Overview :page_facing_up:
### Overview

Aryaverse is a decentralized freelancer platform that allows clients to find and hire freelancers for their projects. It supports smart agreement features b/w clients and freelancers, offers a self-governance system for dispute resolution, supports Stripe payments, and provides a portal to manage freelancers.

As the demand of freelancers increase we need a blockchain that is more scalable and provides the best security. We know Polkadot can fulfil these requirements.

As IT professionals we understand the need of freelancers as well as their data security that's why Aryaverse wants to work immensely to help the freelancers.

### Project Details

Aryaverse is a decentralized platform that leverages blockchain technology to create a secure and transparent marketplace for freelancers and clients. It allows clients to find and hire freelancers around the world while providing a range of features and benefits for both parties.

#### Self-Governance:
Aryaverse allows for self-governance of the platform, which means that the community of users governs the platform. It ensures that the platform is run in the best interests of all parties involved. For example, if a dispute arises between a client and a freelancer, the community of users can vote on a resolution that is fair and just for all parties.
community members are randomly selected from the poll where members stake their tokens to participate in the voting.This process ensures that everyone has a say in the governance of the platform, creating a transparent and democratic system.

#### Smart Agreements:
Aryaverse utilizes smart agreements to ensure that all transactions between clients and freelancers are secure and transparent. Smart agreements are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. This ensures that all parties are held accountable for their obligations and that disputes are resolved quickly and efficiently.

#### Stripe Payments:
Aryaverse supports Stripe payments, which allows clients to pay for services using their credit or debit card. Stripe is a secure and reliable payment gateway that provides clients with peace of mind when making transactions on the platform. This feature allows clients to pay for services quickly and securely, which helps to build trust between clients and freelancers.

#### Portal to Manage Freelancers[optional]:
Aryaverse provides a portal for clients to manage their freelancers. This portal allows clients to keep track of their freelancers, view their work progress, and communicate with them. It ensures that clients are always up-to-date with their freelancer's work and can provide feedback to help improve their performance.
This feature also helps freelancers to stay organized and focused on their work.

#### Escrow:
Aryaverse utilizes an escrow system to ensure that payments are held securely until the work is completed to the client's satisfaction. This ensures that freelancers are paid for their work and clients are satisfied with the final product.

### Technology Stack
Rust, Substrate, Polkadot.js Wallet, IPFS/Filecoin

### Ecosystem Fit

As far as we know, there are no similar projects in Polkadot ecosystem.

Aryaverse is a decentralized platform that leverages blockchain technology to create a secure and transparent marketplace for freelancers and clients. It allows clients to find and hire freelancers worldwide while providing a range of features and benefits for both parties.
As the demand of freelancers increase we need a blockchain that is more scalable and provides the best security.

As we all know Polkadot offers flexible cross-chain interoperation functionality with a large user base and volume expectation.

## Future Plans

Aryaverse Protocol is intended to be a continuously-developing project. we'll implement all the remaining features listed in project description like dispute, payments, slashing etc.
After that, We will launch our chain as a parachain on polkadot.
